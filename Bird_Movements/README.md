## Data Analysis: Bird Movements at a Nesting Box

This project delves into processing a substantial volume of data obtained from an ongoing experiment focused on observing and counting the in-and-out movements of a bird in a nesting box. The observations are logged in a file, each line recording details such as the date, UTC time, and the cumulative count of movements. These observations occur at two-minute intervals, 24 hours a day.

### Objective

The primary objective is to answer several questions through data analysis and visualization:
- How does the total daily count of movements change over the year? Can the breeding and feeding periods be identified?
- Are there movements during the dark hours?
- Is there any correlation between the first and last movement of the day and sunrise/sunset times?
- Detailed hourly analysis is also desired for specific days.

### Data Challenges

Data corruption can arise due to transmission issues or biological reasons:
1. Incomplete counts may be reported, as seen in the example.
2. Entire lines may be missing, leading to irregular intervals between measurements.
3. Biological behaviors like fluttering at the entrance may result in multiple erroneous counts.

### Preprocessing Steps

Several preprocessing steps are necessary:
- Conversion of dates and times into datetime objects.
- Adjustment of the data to the local timezone.
- Handling of data corruptions, such as filling in missing counts or limiting the counts due to biological behaviors.

### Tasks

The following tasks outline the project's steps:
- **Task 1:** Read the data file and convert dates/times to datetime objects.
- **Task 2:** Adjust data to the local timezone.
- **Task 3:** Create functions/methods to address the data corruptions.
- **Task 4:** Compute data for generating plots, allowing user input for start date, number of days, and plot intervals.
- **Task 5:** Generate plots with dates on the x-axis and possibly hours as ticks.
- **Task 6:** Visualize daylight and night phases.
- **Task 7:** Feel free to add custom tasks if time and ideas permit.

Throughout these tasks, Python modules like `datetime` and `astral` can be utilized, with `astral` needing to be installed using the command `conda install --channel https://conda.binstar.org/clausfse astral`. The project encourages using appropriate Python modules for efficient and accurate data analysis and visualization. The goal is to gain insights into the bird's behavior and to depict trends and patterns effectively through graphical representations.
